Selling a home can be daunting. It is often difficult to know the best actions to prepare your home for the market. I have provided a few tips as you make preparations to list your home.

## What Sells a Home?

Making a good first impression is essential. You want your home to shine, to look its best and to stand out above other homes in the area. The Internet has now become the #1 place to showcase your home.  If your home doesn’t present an amazing first impression online, don’t expect to have buyers knocking at your door. Here are a few steps I will take to present an unforgettable first impression.

- Photos are taken on a nice, clear day with proper lighting. Blurry or dark images are unacceptable.
- A well written description highlights the strong aspects of your home.
- Video or panoramic slideshows provide multi-dimensional views to accentuate the home's layout.
- Proper staging will provide buyers a chance to envision the home's potential. I believe this is vital to quickly selling a home. (See below)
- Minor updates/remodeling may be worth the effort in some cases. (See below)
- We will work together to present great curb appeal to showcase your home.

Working to sell a home is a two party endeavor. Your job is to keep your home shining for showings. My job is to utilize my network of contacts to bring potential buyers into your home. As we each do our part, we aim for a quick and profitable sale.

## What About Home Improvements?

While it may be a smart move to make a few improvements, don't overdo it. You want to be able to recoup your investment. How do you know which upgrades are worth the effort and which ones are not?

### What do I *not* need to do?

For the most part, real estate experts agree that new kitchen countertops and appliances, bathroom remodels and energy-saving improvements will pay off in the long run (read below in “What Might I Consider Doing?”). On the other hand, pros point out that the following upgrades are *not* worth your time and money.

- Over-the-Top Improvements
    Before considering elaborate full-house renovations, consider competing properties in your neighborhood. You don't want to overbuild your home. Improvements that place your home in top tier of your neighborhood are unwise.
- A Swimming Pool
    Believe it or not, a swimming pool rarely adds value to a home. First of all, it is costly to have an in-ground swimming pool installed.Secondly, many homebuyers view an in-ground swimming pool as a high-maintenance hassle and safety hazard.
- Enclosed Garage
    Before converting your garage into a game room, take a look around. If every other home in your neighborhood boasts a two-car garage, you should probably think twice. Most home buyers would prefer to have a sheltered place to park their car than a room to play ping pong and darts.
- Daring Design
    Decorating your home so that it reflects your unique style is natural. However, if you're trying to sell your home, now is not the time to incorporate bold design choices into the décor.

### What Might I Consider Doing?

To make the most of your prepatory projects, it pays to keep three types in mind:

1. The Basics  
    The basics are the things that buyers expect when they purchase a home. This includes a roof that doesn't leak, functioning gutters and downspouts, a dry basement, a good furnace, solid floors, walls that are in good repair, retaining walls that work and all of the other common-sense items that you expect to find in a home.

	In upscale properties, this includes air conditioning, a certain number of bedrooms, bathrooms and garages, and any other amenities that are common to the neighborhood.

	Adding these items to a lacking home doesn't add value, it only brings the property up to standard level. Homes are compared to other homes in the area. Money spent on these items is unlikely to be recovered, but will aid the home selling for a price comparable to other homes in the area.

2. Curb Appeal
	Project that add to curb appeal will go a long way with buyers. While these projects may not add a considerable amount of monetary value, they will improve the chances for a quick sell. Curb appeal items include a nice green lawn, attractive landscaping, fresh paint (inside and out), new carpet and new appliances. Simple tasks such as baking an apple pie just before the arrival of a prospective buyer is an easy way to create a warm, inviting atmosphere. 

3. Projects that Add Value
	Projects that offer the most bang for the buck include new siding, kitchen remodeling, bathroom remodeling, new windows, decks and the addition of living space. The National Association of Realtors cites siding, kitchens and windows as some of the most beneficial projects, often recouping 80% or more of their costs during resale.
 
>If you plan to live in your home for many years to come, add amenities that you want regardless of their impact on resale. But when it's time to sell, do the basics to get the property up to par for the neighborhood and add some curb appeal, but don't bother undertaking an extensive array of projects strictly in an effort to increase the value of the property. Even with the projects that are known to add value, the chances are good that you will spend far more money than you will get back in return. -- *Lisa Smith with investopedia*

## What About Staging?

For my clients, I offer staging as a complimentary perk. My Interior Design degree provides expertise in this field. I will assess your home and offer viable suggestions that may include:

- **Painting**
	Neutrals are good, but foyers are a place we can use a nice color. Paint can be an inexpensive way to brighten up a home.
- **Declutter**
	Before pictures are taken, it is important to eliminate clutter. A decluttered home promotes possibilities in the eyes of the buyer. Pack up unnecessary items and furniture.
- **Highlighting Storage Space**
	Storage space sells. Clean and organized closets give the impression of lots of storage.
- **Eliminate Odors**
	Pet odors need to be eliminated.
- **Rooms with a Purpose**
	Each room should be decorated for its purpose. Buyers want to know if it’s an office, bedroom, dining room. Be sure to furnish appropriately. Master bedroom should be appealing to both sexes.
- **Creating Flow**
	Arranging furniture for adequate space is essential. At the same time, positioning pieces so that each room flows will make the house seem larger.
- **Bathrooms and Kitchens**
	Immaculate and up to date bathrooms and kitchens can be determining factors for a potential buyer. Certainly, updates should be appropiate to your budget.
