A MUST SEE HOME on the southeast part of town. This home sits on a corner lot with 2 big, beautiful shade trees and a fenced in backyard. There is a charming front porch just waiting to be adorned with potted plants and a garden table.
When you enter the home you will be pleased to find a freshly painted interior with neutral colors, brand new carpet and flooring (sellers report hardwood floors underneath) over the entire home.  The home is bright and cheerful with all new windows in April 2013.  You will love the architectural charm of this home - with arched walls and a picture window in the living room.

The side entrance gives access to a mudroom with a modern concrete floor to handle messy shoes and attire from the snow and rain.  This area is perfect for coat hooks, shelves and a cute bench.  

Off of the mudroom is the quite large 3rd bedroom, with a sizeable walk-in closet. The laundry and storage room is also off of the mudroom.  Here you will find a new water heater in 2013 and lots of storage space.

Along with tons of updates and a new roof in April 2013, this home is ready for you to add your personality and style.  Come take a look!
