If you love the architectural design that was so masterfully displayed in the grand homes of yesteryear, then you will want to see this home! A wealth of space filled with character. You will find original wooden ceiling beams in the living room, original wooden parquet ceiling in the dining room, stunning woodwork on the stairwell and window/door trim. Hardwood floors throughout. Living room and foyer have hardwood floors under the carpet matching that of the dining room. Large 4 pc. bathrooms. Don't overlook French doors throughout. Several choices for your relaxing pleasure - a glassed-in, adorable front porch; or sit in the swing and enjoy the breeze under the covered front porch; or grill out in the backyard on the double deck with your own privacy fence, mature trees, and landscaping. If you've always wanted that cozy nook - the attic is ready to be finished off providing a wonderful spot. Taylor University is located in nearby Upland, IN.
