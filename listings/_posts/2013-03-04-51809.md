Good starter home or investment property. Conveniently located near Ball State University, IU Ball Memorial Hospital, McGalliard shopping, and Muncie Mall. This 3 bedroom, 1 bath dwelling has updated laminate flooring in kitchen. A large family room with a wood burning stove leads to a glassed sunporch. A spacious living room, with a bay window, is located off the kitchen. Updated central air conditioning. Updated vinyl thermo pane windows. A detached 2car garage is great for extra storage and workshop. A few minor updates can transform this property into a delightful home.
