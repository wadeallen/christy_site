## Training and Life Experiences

Thanks for visiting my Web site. I’d like to introduce myself to you.  My **training**, as well as **life experiences**, have prepared me for success in helping my clients:

- Earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Ecology from [Liberty University](http://www.liberty.edu/), with a minor in Interior Design has equipped me with fundamental knowledge regarding human environments.
- Personally relocating several times in my life has aided my understanding of the ins and outs of moving to a new city. 
- Selling and buying 3-4 personal homes allows me to understand Real Estate transactions from each side.
- Serving with my husband in ministry since 1994 has created an adeptness for working with people. Understanding different personality types is an important factor in negotiating transactions.
- A love for people and a love for human environments drives my career as a Realtor. Helping families find a home that suits their needs is rewarding. At the same time, helping sellers capitalize on one of their most valuable assets can prove to be vital as they relocate. 
- I am a mother to three. My children have taught me about human nature, patience and fulfilling goals.

## Two Faces of a Realtor

There are two sides of a Realtor - the **listing agent** and the **buyer’s agent**.

I have goals for each.  

As a listing agent, my desire is to help you make the most of one of your most valuable assets. In today's world, the Internet is the primary way in which your home will be showcased.  It’s the new “curb appeal.” Making a fabulous first impression is essential to attract buyers to your home. I have developed a marketing strategy with a goal of selling your home quickly and bringing you the most money. As a complimentary perk to my clients, I offer staging advice. As someone who has studied Interior Design, I have a knack for detail. I provide a customized, feasible list of suggestions/modifications to each seller.

### For the Seller

I will provide for you, the seller:

- A customized listing on **MLS**  
	Having your home on MLS is paramount for a quick and profitable sell. MLS (Multiple Listing Service) is the most comprehensive computerized database of homes for sale with over 1.5 million listings nationwide. This database is used by Realtors to market and promote their own listings and to cooperate with other Realtors. By having your home in MLS, it will be exposed to thousands of local real estate agents who otherwise would not have known that your property was for sale and would not have shown it. A listing on MLS will syndicate your home to Zillow, Trulia and other highly ranked sites.
- A **network** of **relationships**  
	I will represent your home to my network of people. This includes prospective buyers and other agents (with their propective buyers). These relationships are crucial as they serve to find an abundance of potential buyers for your property. My own Web site and social networks will provide additional exposure for your home.
- A customized **list of suggestions** for your property  
	My background in Interior Design makes me detail oriented in my approach to selling homes. Often, attention to detail can make for a quick and profitable sell. I will take the time to coach you in preparing your home for your first showing.

### For the Buyer

I will provide for you, the buyer:

- Complete and customized **searches** for the property that fits your family’s wants and needs.  
	My exposure to properties in the area will help narrow your search for the right property. With access to special databases, I will be able to narrow your search for optimum matches for your family.
- **Insight** into a home's potential  
	My expertise in Interior Design will provide insight into the hidden potential for each property. As we narrow your search, I will provide suggestions for transformations or adaptations that could be the difference between just another property and your ideal home environment.

Finding a home should be fun and exciting. I can help you discover the joy of buying one of your most important assets. I’d love to chat with you more about my complete marketing strategy.

I believe in doing a job right, representing honesty and integrity. I have chosen this career because I have a passion for people and human environments. I hope you will trust me to help you with one of your family's most momentous transactions.
